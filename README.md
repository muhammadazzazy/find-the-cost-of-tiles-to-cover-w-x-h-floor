# Find the Cost of Tiles to Cover W x H Floor
This is a Python implementation for a program that obtains the cost of tiles required to cover a floor based on the dimensions provided by the user. The cost per square unit must be entered with a currency symbol at the beginning. Moreover, the width and height must be entered with the same units of length. The cost per square unit entered is assumed to be associated with the same length units entered. The program currently supports the following units of length:
- meters (m)
- centimeters (cm)
- millimeters (mm)
- inches (in or '')

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
